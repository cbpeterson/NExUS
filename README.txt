--> 'Data_generate.m' generates the precision matrices and dataset corresponding to that as described in the simulation study. 

--> In case of real data, note that it is recommended to normalize the sample corresponding to each variable in the data to have mean 0 and variance 1.

--> 'NExUS.m' computes the estimated partial correlation matrices corresponding to the dataset.Variable 'Partial_corr_mean' (which is a 3D array) gives the all estimated      partial correlation matrices. Variable 'lambda_2_square_mean' provides the similarity index for each pair of categories.
